		<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px"> I was finding myself, and you gave me everything I needed and wanted. I opened up about being kinda crazy, and you asked to kiss me hours later. Like the sun and moon, you shined a light on my darkness and I reflected it back. An equal give and take; a duo even strangers had to stop and admire. With you life, was a movie; my doubts, the commercial breaks in between. You healed me in ways I failed to appreciate. But deep down, I was settling for something I thought I deserved. I guess all movies have to end at some point. Spinoffs usually suck anyway.</p>
