		Memories continously reverberate in my head.
		Your voice, an echo of the past.
		Your essence, a whisper in the wind.

		I go back to 2020 and 22,
		And think about me and you,
		And wonder why we couldn't be true.
		The ascension, the destuction, and the
		rebirth.
		With you, my traumas unearthed and
		brought out the worst in me.
		
		And now you're with the raccoon that,
		was digging through my scraps while
		I was still taking it out.
		And I have no choice but to
		move on.
